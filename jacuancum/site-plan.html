        About Me
        I joined the aviation industry and thought that I could work in this industry until I retired. However, the world environment changed and the company laid off employees.  For the sake of my family, I looked around for different jobs.
        I found this great opportunity available in Hong Kong in 2022. Since the protests activities and the epidemic spread in Hong Kong and China, the uncertainty social condition rises the unemployment and business closures.
        I am sincerely grateful for this opportunity to study and fulfill his dream of a university degree that I never achieved.

        Camping 
        Camping is a healthy activity, especially when you have children. Outdoor camping can bring many benefits. Children can explore nature and have many new attempts, which are lacking in urban life.

        Handmade camping table
        Handmade camping table, since I fell in love with camping, I tried to make some gadgets by hand, because the props I have made by myself I can feel more warm than things bought with money.
        One time, a friend saw my camping table I made by myself and suggested me I can sell it online. Luckily, I received a lot of inquiries. Since then, I have been producing a small amount of handmade camping table for sell.
